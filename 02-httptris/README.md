Tetris in the browser using only HTML.

To run it do:

    node server.js [port]

Server runs on port 12000 by default

Keyboard shortcuts are using html accesskey so you need to hold down the modifier keys to use them (ctrl+opt on the mac) 

The entire thing was build in 3 hours so it's probably a bit hacky :)

### Happy hacking!
